The Prey behave according to the following model: 
Move) Every time step, randomly try to move up, down, left, or right. 
If the neighboring cell in the selected direction is occupied or would move the ant off the grid, then the ant stays in the current cell.

Breed) If an ant survives for three time steps, then at the end of the time step (that is; after moving) the ant will breed. 
This is simulated by creat-ing a new ant in an adjacent (up, down, left, or right) cell that is empty. If there is no empty cell available, then no breeding occurs. 
Once an off-spring is produced, an ant cannot produce an offspring until three more time steps have elapsed.

The Predators behave according to the following model:
Move) Every time step, if there is an adjacent ant (up, down, left, or right), then the doodlebug will move to that cell and eat the ant.
Otherwise, the doodlebug moves according to the same rules as the ant. Note that a doodlebug cannot eat other doodlebugs.

Breed) If a doodlebug survives for eight time steps, then at the end of the time step it will spawn off a new doodlebug in the same manner as the ant.
Starve) If a doodlebug has not eaten an ant within the last three time steps, then at the end of the third time step it will starve and die. 
The doodlebug should then be removed from the grid of cells.

During one turn, all the doodlebugs should move before the ants do.
